      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Cocoa is the essential ingredient in many of the world's most loved products. It's production mainly takes place in Ghana and Cote dâ€™Ivoire. But how much do we actually know about this sector, and the lives of the farmers producing it?</p>
      <p>In 2016, the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) initiated a study into the lives of approximately 3000 randomly selected farmer households in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire. This resulted in a dataset which can help demystify the cocoa sector in these countries.</p>
      <p>This interactive website aims to provide visitors with the tools to explore this data themselves. By providing you with multiple filter options and comparative functions you can see what influences a farmers income and food security.</p>
      <p>For demonstration purposes we decided to focus on the data from Ghana, which provided us with 1560 different households to explore.</p>
